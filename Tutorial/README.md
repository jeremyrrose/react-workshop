React is a widely used front-end framework originally developed by Facebook and designed to enable highly interactive user interfaces. React is built out of JavaScript and operates in a Node.js environment.

Full documentation for the framework [**can be found here**](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

The following is a *very* shallow overview of React's key features, interspersed with build-it-yourself challenges.
